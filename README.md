#SunshineWatchFace
Project 6 - Android Nanodegree - **Go Ubiquitous**

It uses [the final branch of Sunshine from Advanced Android App Development](https://github.com/udacity/Advanced_Android_Development/tree/7.05_Pretty_Wallpaper_Time "the final branch of Sunshine from Advanced Android App Development") 

The app synchronizes weather information from OpenWeatherMap on Android Phones and Tablets.

For this assignment I built a wearable watch face for Sunshine to run on an Android Wear device. 

I learned the fundamentals of Android Wear and took into account design for multiple watch form factors.
I also implemented communicate between a mobile device and the wearable device using Google API's Wearable API to send and sync data.
